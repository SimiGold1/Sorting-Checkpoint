# Insertion Sort Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly inserting elements into the right position within a sorted sequence.

## Algorithm Description

The Insertion Sort algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with the second element in the array.
2. Iterate over the array and for each element:
   - Store the current element in a variable.
   - Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted sequence (from index 0 to `i - 1`).
   - Shift the elements in the sorted sequence to the right if they are greater than the current element.
   - Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted sequence.
3. Repeat the above steps until the entire array is sorted.
